## FPGA Environment Quality Monitoring System

### Description

The FPGA Environment Quality Monitoring System is a project developed by Team Quantum Byte Brawlers. This system monitors and records environmental parameters, including temperature and humidity, using FPGA technology interfaced with DHT22 sensors. The collected data is then visualized for analysis, making it suitable for various applications such as agriculture, climate monitoring, and more.
